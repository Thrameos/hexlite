% This cycle goes only through an aggregate and is checked by clasp.
t :- 1 = #sum{ Y : s(Y) }.
s(1) :- t.

% The following two rules form a cycle which goes
% both through an aggregate and an external atom.
% This results in nonminimal models because
% clasp can handle only aggregates and
% the dlvhex UFS checker can handle only external atoms.
% Thus, their combination is not considered in the minimality check.
q(X) :- dom(X), &id[p](X).
p(1) :- 1 = #sum{ Z : q(Z) }.

% In contrast, with --aggregate-mode=ext, the cycle IS detected as
% the aggregate is rewritten to an external atom.
